/**
 * Rooms DB
 *
 * This code will be in charge of keeping and maintain a cache of the
 * rooms created and the ones we get an invitation, storing as well
 * all events related with the RoomObject.
 * Events will be:
 *   - Room Created: Time and subject
 *   - Room Renamed: Time and new subject
 *   - Anyone Joined: Time and Who
 *   - I joined: Time
 *   - Communication established: Time and with who
 *
 * The object will have the following schema:
 *
 * RoomSchema: {
 *   roomToken: <string> (primary key),
 *   roomUrl: <string>,
 *   roomName: <string> (index),
 *   roomOwner: <string>,
 *   maxSize: <Number>,
 *   creationTime: <Date> (index),
 *   expiresAt: <Date>,
 *   ctime: <Date>,
 *   localCtime: <Date> (index), // Automatically updated
 *   events: [
 *     {
 *       // EventObject
 *       id: <Number>,
 *       action: <String>,
 *       date: <Date> (index),
 *       params: {}
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 *
 * Based on this info, we will expose the methods under the Object
 * RoomsDB, you can check above.
